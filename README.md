# RSATsetlinMachine
An attempt to implement RSA algorithm above naive Tsetlin Machine to optimize hyperparameters.

Including a simple xorDemo of TsetlinMachine modified from [this work](https://github.com/222464/TsetlinMachine.git), a concave function optimization demo of RSA algorithm and a RSA & TsetlinMachine demo targeting on siRNA silence efficiency predict and pattern recognition.

Directory data/ consists of 1200+ siRNA sequences and their efficiency targeting Human e2s gene,which is obtained from [Huesken's work](http://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1118)  

Considering precision and robustness issues, this work is not yet mature, later I will add clause dropout, boost architectures, and if fortunate, larger datasets.
